## 🔗 Share Link Format

Your share links will look like this:
```
http://localhost:3000/shared/a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                              Unique Token
```

- Each portfolio gets a unique token
- The token is randomly generated and secure
- The same token is used if you unshare and re-share

## 📱 What Others See

When someone clicks your share link, they will see:

1. **Portfolio Header**
   - Your portfolio title
   - Description (if provided)
   - Template and theme used
   - View count

2. **Portfolio Preview**
   - Full portfolio content with your selected theme
   - Interactive and responsive design
